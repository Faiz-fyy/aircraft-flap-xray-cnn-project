Aircraft Flap X-Ray CNN Dataset - Synthetic Data Creation Note

Overview
This synthetic dataset replicates the structure and visual characteristics of real-world aircraft flap X-ray radiographic images, ensuring complete data anonymization for public sharing and educational purposes.

Data Generation Methodology

Statistical Fidelity
The synthetic data was engineered to match key statistical characteristics observed in the original dataset:
- Water ingression rate: approximately 60% matching the proportion from real CNN training data
- Class distribution: Maintained the 60% water vs 40% nil distribution reflecting operational findings
- Sample size: Scalable from 5 test images to 1000+ production datasets
- Image dimensions: 512px width with variable height (300-350px) matching CNN input requirements

Realistic Visual Patterns
Several domain-specific patterns were incorporated to ensure the synthetic data reflects authentic X-ray radiographic characteristics:

Honeycomb Structure: Proper hexagonal cell patterns (45-50 vertical, 55-60 horizontal cells) with consistent wall thickness

Water Ingression: Organic flow patterns using Perlin noise algorithms with clustered and scattered distributions, gravity-influenced bottom-heavy patterns, multi-severity classification (Light: 5%, Moderate: 20%, Severe: 40%, Extreme: 80% outliers)

Repair Work: Geometric bright patterns (horizontal/vertical lines, L-shapes, hollow patches) with 3-5 cell thickness, maintaining brightness similar to water ingression

X-ray Physics: Authentic radiographic effects including quantum noise, film grain, density-based contrast variations, and conditional skew transformation (4% probability)

Lead Markings: Professional text rendering (4.5% probability) with authentic lead block letter markings

Data Anonymization Features
- Structural anonymization: Generic honeycomb patterns remove aircraft-specific composite configurations
- Equipment abstraction: Standardized cell dimensions mask proprietary manufacturing specifications  
- Process anonymization: Synthetic repair patterns eliminate traceability to specific maintenance procedures
- Image ID masking: Sequential SE-codes replace actual radiographic exposure identifiers

Technical Specifications
- Resolution: 512px width, 300-350px height optimized for CNN training
- File format: PNG with class-prefixed sequential naming (water_SE001.png, nil_SE002.png)
- Generation pipeline: Multi-layer composition with hexagonal pattern creation, water simulation, repair work application, and film effects processing

Educational Value
This dataset enables practitioners to:
- Develop CNN architectures for defect detection in composite structures
- Practice transfer learning techniques with domain-specific radiographic data
- Explore computer vision applications in safety-critical aviation environments
- Apply confidence scoring frameworks for operational deployment
- Build production-ready image processing pipelines for digital radiography

Limitations and Real-World Complexity
Important Note: Real-life X-ray radiographic data exhibits significantly greater complexity than this synthetic representation. This dataset serves as a foundational tool for computer vision development but should not be considered a complete representation of operational radiographic complexity.

Data Security Note
The synthetic generation process ensures no reverse-engineering of original business intelligence, operational patterns, or proprietary maintenance procedures while maintaining analytical complexity suitable for data science practice and portfolio development in aerospace NDT applications.
